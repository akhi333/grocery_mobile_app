# Next Steps to Complete Flutter Setup

## Current Status âœ…
- Flutter project structure is properly set up
- All Dart files are organized in correct directories
- pubspec.yaml is configured with necessary dependencies
- Android configuration files are created
- Project is ready for Flutter SDK setup

## Next Steps

### 1. Flutter SDK Setup
Since there are network connectivity issues, try these alternatives:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the cloned Flutter repository
export PATH="/home/runner/flutter/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="/home/runner/flutter/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Option 2: If network connectivity is resolved, download via snap
sudo snap install flutter --classic

# Option 3: Manual download and extract
# Visit: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux
```

### 2. Verify Flutter Installation
```bash
flutter doctor
flutter doctor --android-licenses  # Accept Android licenses
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/grocery_mobile_app/grocery_mobile_app
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Android Setup (Since Android Studio is already installed)
```bash
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Create virtual device or connect physical device
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
# or
adb devices  # to check connected devices
```

### 5. Test the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### 6. Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Run `flutter doctor -v` for detailed diagnostics
- Check `flutter config` for configuration issues
- Verify Android SDK path is correctly set
